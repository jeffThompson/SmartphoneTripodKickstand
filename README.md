SMARTPHONE TRIPOD KICKSTAND
====

A little kickstand for a cheap smartphone tripod mount.

### FITTING TO YOUR PHONE

This version is best for an iPhone 6, which is about 3.5" wide. If your phone is similar in dimension (within 1/2" or so), this will work easily as is. For significantly larger or smaller phones, the stand is still usable but won't give you the best range of angles.

To fit your phone, you will need to modify the print file, either by extending the leg or shrinking it. (You could also just print it and saw off a piece by hand 😊.)

### FILES

* 3DM: original Rhino CAD file

### PARTS

* 1 @ smartphone tripod mount ($6, very cheap)

* 1 @ 0.0355" diameter x 1.125" long music wire

A small piece of spring steel wire works very well, but you can also use a cut-off drill bit or paperclip; superglue it into one end of the hinge to keep it from fallling out – adding a slight bend can help add some tension in the hinge and keep it in place when adjusting  

And one of the following:  

* 1 @ 1/4"-20 x 3/8" low head cap screw (~$5 for a pack of 10)

Minimal and doesn't stick out, but will require an allen key to flip  
* 1 @ 1/4"-20 x 7/16" cap screw (~$5 for a pack of 50)  
This will be a more permanent, but low-profile setup

* 1 @ 1/4"-20 x 7/16" cap screw (~$5 for a pack of 50, sadly)

1 @ matching thumbscrew cap (~$9 for a pack of 50, too)

(Optionally, this part is included in the printer file, so you can maybe print one that will work instead.)
