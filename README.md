SMARTPHONE TRIPOD KICKSTAND
====

A little kickstand for a cheap smartphone tripod mount.

### FITTING TO YOUR PHONE

This version is best for an iPhone 6, which is about 3.5" wide. If your phone is similar in dimension (within 1/2" or so), this will work easily as is. For significantly larger or smaller phones, the stand is still usable but won't give you the best range of angles.

To fit your phone, you will need to modify the print file, either by extending the leg or shrinking it. (You could also just print it and saw off a piece by hand ðŸ˜Š.)

### PARTS

1 @ smartphone tripod mount ($6, very cheap)  
https://amzn.com/B00WFNNNCC

1 @ 1.125" long steel rod  
A small piece of spring steel wire works very well, or a cut-off drill bit; superglue it into one end to keep it from fallling out

1 @ 1/4"-20 x 7/16" cap screw (~$5 for a pack of 50)
This will be a more permanent, but low-profile setup
